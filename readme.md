# ETTODAY-Shorts-Generator

![](./demo/webpage.png)

## Introduction

This is a project that we implement the system that can let the user provide some contents and pictures, \
then this system can make a "shorts" video that is relative to this topic with just one click.

## How to install dependencies

Use `pip install -r requirement.txt` to install those dependencies.

```
Yating-TTS-SDK==0.1.2
pydub==0.25.1
aiohttp==3.8.6 
aiosignal==1.3.1 
async-timeout==4.0.3 
frozenlist==1.4.0 
multidict==6.0.4 
openai==0.28.1 
yarl==1.9.2

You also need to install `ffmpeg` to edit audio (pydub relies on it):

```
sudo apt-get update && apt-get upgrade
```

## How to use
We wrote a simple front-end webpage for user to input their data.

Use the following command to start the webpage server:
```
python3 webpage.py
```
After the webpage is built, then you can visit the webpage by clicking the link below (in the terminal).
## What APIs do we use
We use serveral APIs to complete this project. Including OpenAI, Yating TTS, and DeepAI.

In order to use their service, you need to fill up their APIs in the following position:

#### Yating TTS: `audio.py line 13`
#### OpenAI: `image.py line 18` and  `script.py line 166`
#### DeepAI: `image.py line 40`

## Figma demo
Here is the link to the figma of how we think their APP should be redesigned into.
